# Hoax Detection

Created by Fitria Dwi Wulandari â€“ September, 2020

#### <ins>**Project Background**</ins>
In today's digital age, the spread of misinformation and fake news poses a significant challenge, impacting public opinion, decision-making processes, and even social cohesion. Recognizing the importance of combating this issue, the project aims to develop a Hoax Detection model capable of identifying and flagging potentially deceptive content across various online platforms.

#### <ins>**Objectives**</ins>
1. Identified the percentage of hoax and non-hoax articles.
2. Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict the truth of the articles that are hoax or non-hoax.
3. Implemented the best model to predict unseen data.
   
#### <ins>**Methodology**</ins>
* **Data Preparation**: data is provided from the Satria Data program.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: process to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics.
* **Text Data Cleaning**: cleaning text data involves removing unnecessary noise, transforming text into a consistent format, and handling any irregularities that may hinder meaningful analysis.
* **Data Modelling**: build a predictive model to predict sentiment from feedback provided by users. 4 algorithms were tried and then evaluated to determine the best algorithm for the prediction model.

#### <ins>Results</ins>
The best model to predict the truth of the article is the Logistic Regression Model, with an accuracy value of 83%.

#### <ins>Tools</ins>
Google Spreadsheet, Python.

#### <ins>Skill Sets</ins>
Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, NLP, Text Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis.
